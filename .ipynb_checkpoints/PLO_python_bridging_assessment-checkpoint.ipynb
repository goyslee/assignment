This assessment is designed to gauge your knowledge of Python programming, as well as your understanding of predictive models including classification, regression and time-series forecasting. Throughout the completion of this notebook, you will be tasked to apply technical coding skills, demonstrate your proficiency in handling different types of data and showcase your ability to build and refine predictive algorithms. Keep in mind that, while understanding the concepts is crucial, implementation plays an equally important role in mastering Python and data science techniques. \n",
